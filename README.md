üß† Machine Learning Projects
This repository contains three different machine learning projects that demonstrate classification using various models and datasets:

üìÅ Files Included
CNN model to classify handwritten digits.ipynb
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras to classify digits using the MNIST dataset.

Decision tree classifier to predict iris species.ipynb
A simple Decision Tree classifier using Scikit-learn to predict iris flower species based on petal and sepal measurements.

ML_with_spaCY.ipynb
A Natural Language Processing (NLP) example using spaCy to perform tasks like rule-based classification or text analysis (e.g., sentiment or review classification).

üß™ Project Summaries
1. CNN for Handwritten Digit Classification
Dataset: MNIST or custom digit images

Framework: TensorFlow & Keras

Functionality: Trains a CNN to classify digits from 0‚Äì9 with high accuracy.

Features:

Custom image preprocessing

Support for image input via OpenCV

Potential web interface via Flask (see planned extensions)

2. Decision Tree Classifier - Iris Dataset
Dataset: Iris dataset from sklearn.datasets

Framework: Scikit-learn

Functionality: Classifies iris flower species using petal/sepal length & width.

Features:

Data visualization

Confusion matrix and accuracy reports

Easy to interpret decision boundaries

3. spaCy Rule-based NLP Classifier
Dataset: Amazon reviews or custom text samples

Framework: spaCy

Functionality: Demonstrates basic NLP tasks like text parsing and rule-based classification.

Features:

Custom rule matching

Can be expanded to sentiment classification

Bias analysis possible using fairness tools

‚öñÔ∏è Ethics & Bias Considerations
MNIST Digit Classifier: Could misclassify digits written in unique or non-Western handwriting styles.

Iris Classifier: Uses a well-structured dataset, but real-world flora datasets may have class imbalance.

Text Classifier (spaCy): Language models may carry biases from pre-trained data.

Tools to reduce bias:

Use TensorFlow Fairness Indicators

Add data augmentation or diverse handwriting samples for MNIST

Apply spaCy‚Äôs Matcher and EntityRuler with diverse patterns

üõ†Ô∏è How to Run
Clone or download this repository.

Open each .ipynb file using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

Install the dependencies:

bash
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
(Optional: create requirements.txt listing tensorflow, numpy, opencv-python, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, spacy, etc.)
